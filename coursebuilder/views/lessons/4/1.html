    Technovation Challenge is a program of Iridescent (a 501Â©3 nonprofit) 
    in which middle and high school girls are exposed to STEM (science, 
    technology, engineering, and math) through designing and programming a 
    mobile app. We aim to inspire girls to enter the field of technology by 
    providing them with role models (your mentor!) and an experience of 
    creating their very own high-tech product.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    In addition to designing and programming their app, girls learn 
    business strategies, such as Lean Thinking. Lean Thinking is a term 
    coined by Eric Ries of Lean Startup where entrepreneurs are encouraged 
    to get feedback from their customers before developing a polished 
    finished product. If their target customers do not like the fundamental 
    idea of their app, then teams pivot. Pivoting means that the product (1)
    needs to broaden in its scope, (2) a component of the product needs to 
    become to entire product, or (3) the app can be applied to a different 
    target customer. Pivoting early on (based on consumer feedback) will 
    save considerable time and resources, so we encourage teams to conduct 
    market research with their target customers early on in the Challenge.
