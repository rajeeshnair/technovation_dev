  <div class="paragraph">
    Welcome to Technovation Challenge!&nbsp;
    Before you begin the program, please complete a simple 
    <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/presurvey2013">student pre-survey</a>
    (each girl completes the survey). The survey takes about 5 minutes to complete.
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    At the end of the program, we will ask you to complete a "post-survey."
    Surveys help us learn what we can do to improve the program for our 
    students. Thank you for your help.
